Any kind of structured storage is DB
why disk based dbs :- very cheap comared to RAM,

DBMS responsible to provide CRUD Operation
A
C
I 
D

DBMS responsibility:
Data Organisation 
Integrity: Accuracy and validity of data(the data is not corrupt or valid)
ex: in stocks left in ecommerce system, then number should be enter so that dbms make sure only number data type and no other 
data type entered

Why not txt files? 
1.Problem is parsing , parse all the lines and compare each field which is very time taking u can
also corrupt ur data or provide wrong info and so also error prone

2. txt file has no structure and so hard to enforce consistency(It prevents invalid data from being stored and ensures that 
any transaction,if it violates these rules, is rolled back to preserve the database's integrity)

3. Concurrency:2 differect user trying to change same variable there should be a consistent mechanism so that
consistency exist

DBMS types:1. Relational, 2.Non-Relational


Postgres: very good JSON support, that why people prefered in non-relational but now in relational db in Postgres
along with good query support and great scalability, if no strict schem then use JSON schema and dump it

Postgres is the dbms where we execute using sql queries


case insensitive upper case more readable


Commands: Usually SQL commands
Update:
