CREATE VIEW billing_info as
select * from employee e join student s on e.s_id=s.s_id
join courses s on e.c_id=c.c_id;

select * from billing_info; -- same result



HAVING:
Select p_name,sum(total_price) as Amount from billing_info group by p_name 
Having sum(total_price)>1500;

SELECT 
    p_name, 
    SUM(total_price) AS Amount
FROM billing_info
GROUP BY ROLLUP(p_name)
HAVING SUM(total_price) > 1500;

ROLLUP generates a grand total,(but the row name will be null)

    SUM(total_price) AS Amount
FROM billing_info
GROUP BY ROLLUP(p_name)
HAVING SUM(total_price) > 1500;
