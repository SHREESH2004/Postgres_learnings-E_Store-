In PostgreSQL, a View is essentially a saved query that you can treat like a virtual table. 
It doesn't store any data physically on the disk; instead, every time you query the view,

CREATE VIEW billing_info as
select * from employee e join student s on e.s_id=s.s_id
join courses s on e.c_id=c.c_id;


then if
select * from billing_info; -- same result

HAVING:
Select p_name,sum(total_price) as Amount from billing_info group by p_name 
Having sum(total_price)>1500;

SELECT 
    p_name, 
    SUM(total_price) AS Amount
FROM billing_info
GROUP BY ROLLUP(p_name)
HAVING SUM(total_price) > 1500;

ROLLUP generates a grand total,(but the row name will be null)

SELECT 
    COALESCE(p_name, 'GRAND TOTAL') AS p_name, 
    SUM(total_price) AS Amount
FROM billing_info
GROUP BY ROLLUP(p_name)
HAVING SUM(total_price) > 1500;

if any null comes it will show grand total in the row
