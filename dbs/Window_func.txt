A Window Function is a powerful SQL tool that performs calculations across a set of rows that are related to the current row.

The "superpower" of a window function is that it does not collapse your data. While a normal GROUP BY turns 10 rows into 1 summary row, 
a window function keeps all 10 rows and adds a calculated value to each one.

the OVER clause is what transforms a standard function (like SUM or AVG) into a Window Function.

SUM(salary) OVER(),Grand Total: Every row shows the sum of the entire table.
SUM(salary) OVER(ORDER BY id),Cumulative: Each row shows the sum of itself + all previous rows.
SUM(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY dept),Sub-Total: Every row shows the total for its specific department only.
